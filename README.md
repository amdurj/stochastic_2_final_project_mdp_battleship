# stochastic_2_final_project_mdp_battleship
Final project on Markov Decision Processes

Project is to create a game of battleship that a human can play against a MDP based program. This game is a variation on battleship where users can either fire or move a ship one space. Work is continuing actively on this. 

## Files
**main_scripts/play_battleship.py**: Working code that allows for gameplay. Run this in terminal by calling python3 play_battleship.py. Suggest first playing with random to see how it works.

**main_scripts/play_battleship.ipynb**: Working jupyter notebook that allows for gameplay and has the evaluation outputs done. Suggest only looking at the outputs here. 

**main_scripts/play_battleship_alternate_version.py**: Previous work done to begin an alternate version where moving ships was allowed. Work done, but not completed for this. 

**main_scripts/play_battleship_alternate_version.ipynb**: Previous jupyter notebook work done to begin an alternate version where moving ships was allowed. Work done, but not completed for this.
