# stochastic_2_final_project_mdp_battleship
Final project on Markov Decision Processes

Project is to create a game of battleship that a human can play against a MDP based program. This game is a variation on battleship where users can either fire or move a ship one space. Work is continuing actively on this. 

## Files
**main_scripts/play_battleship**: Working code that allows for gameplay. Current setup is still in evaluation phase and will change heavily once finalized.

**src/MDP_player.py**: Initial script for the MDP player function. Current version was work spent on reading in the MDPtoolbox R library into python. This will be the main focus of the next half of the project.
